### File an Issue
If briefs is exhibiting unexpected behavior, please file an issue that allows the maintainers to reproduce the results you see.

4. Tell us what the unexpected behavior was, e.g. a stack trace with the error or a screen shot.
5. Expound upon any steps you took to remedy the issue.

You may also use issues to submit feature requests.


### Get Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes in a topic branch
3. Rebase against `origin/master`, submit a pull request


### Linking Briefs
In order to see and test the changes you've made to Briefs, you'll need to [uninstall](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-uninstall.html) any previously installed versions of Briefs and [link](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) your local Briefs.

1. `npm uninstall -g generator-briefs`
2. `cd path/to/briefs/repo`
3. `npm link`
4. `cd path/to/desired/location`
5. `yo briefs`

The resulting Briefs generator will be referencing your local copy of the Briefs respository rather than an installed published release.


### Git Commit Messages
- Capitalize your commit messages.
- Start your message with a verb.
- Use present tense.

### SCSS Style Guide
- Follow the [Centresource FE Guidelines](https://sites.google.com/a/centresource.com/csintranet/Home/development/centresource-fe-dev-guide).
- Two spaces, no tabs.
- Dashes instead of underscores or camel case: `span-columns` **not** `span_columns` or `spanColumns`
- Names should be descriptive and written in full-words: `$visual-grid-color` **not** `$color` or `$vslgrd-clr`
- Space between property and value: `width: 20px` **not** `width:20px`
- Declarations within a block should be ordered alphabetically.
- Blank lines between rules.
- No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.


### Tagging and Publishing Releases
1. Update the [package version](https://github.com/centresource/generator-briefs/blob/master/package.json#L3) in `package.json`. This should match the version number that you are publishing to [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-briefs).
2. Commit your version bump: `git commit -am "Version bump."`
3. Create an [annoted git tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging#Annotated-Tags) for the release: `git tag -a v#.#.# -m "Version #.#.#"`
4. Push master/tags: `git push origin master --tags`
5. Publish to npm: `npm publish`

**NOTE**: Briefs is using [semver](http://semver.org/). Do not break this pattern.
